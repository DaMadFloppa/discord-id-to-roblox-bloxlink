# discord-id-to-roblox-bloxlink
this is made by me so try to include my name in the code but if not, it is completely fine but thanks.

Requirements:
Python 3.7+ |![py_aRj2W9244R](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83959094/117658453-bb2dfb00-b168-11eb-9b53-35e5a65f9e42.png)

Pip |
Windows |
pip install requests




This does use blox.link's API which is ratelimits to 60 checks per IP Address, I may make a faster program which goes through a text file with proxies and checks all of the ids usernames and export them to a file. (pretty useless but yeah)
